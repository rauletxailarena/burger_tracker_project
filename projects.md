## Burger Tracker

Jarrod has an insatiable hunger for burgers. However, he only has a limited budget, so prefers to go to places that have a deal on. He would like a way to track which deals are available at which places on a given day so that he can maximise his burger intake for minimum spending.

### MVP:

- Add a burger eatery
- Add burgers available at an eatery and view them as a list
- Add a list of deals for an eatery where a deal has
  - Label string e.g. "Two For One Tuesdays"
  - A list of burgers that deal applies to
  - The day that the deal is available on e.g. "Wednesday"

### Possible Extensions:

- Show the deals available by day of the week Mon - Sun
- Add a price to a burger and add a savings amount/percentage to a deal so it's clear how much Steven is saving
- Any other ideas you might come up with
